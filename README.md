## Editing docs

The documentation is written using Jekyll. A usefull getting started guide
can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)

Once you have the pre-requisites installed, navigate to the docs directory and run:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

This will serve the docs locally and will update as you change the source.
