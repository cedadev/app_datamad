# Contributing

There are several ways you can get involved with contributing to DataMAD.

1. Reporting Issues
2. Contributing to this user guide
3. Contributing to the code

### {% include linked_header.html title="Reporting Issues" %}

The code for DataMAD is managed through GitHub. If you have a GitHub account, you
can create issues directly in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cedadev/datamad2/issues). 

If you do not have a GitHub account, and do not want one, then you can email [support@ceda.ac.uk](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk).
Make sure to put datamad in the subject line and it will be picked up by the developers.

If you find yourself on an error page e.g. 404 or 500, then there should be a contact form which will go to the
same email address. This captures information such as the page you were trying to reach and can help us in finding the
cause of the issue.

### {% include linked_header.html title="Docs Contributions" %}

User guides are best made by the users. If there are small changes or new sections you would like adding there 
are 3 things you can do:

1. Submit an issue through [GitHub](https://github.com/cedadev/datamad2/issues) explaining what you would like to see changed or added.
2. Use GitHub's fork workflow to make the changes yourself and request to merge them back in.
3. Email [support@ceda.ac.uk](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk) to request the changes.

#### GitHub Workflow for making changes to the documentation

3. You can either work using the GitHub IDE or work on it locally
4. Commit changes and create a merge request back to the main repo
