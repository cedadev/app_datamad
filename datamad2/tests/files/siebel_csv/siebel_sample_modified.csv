NE/H014888/1,Autonomous observations of energetic particle effects on the Antarctic atmosphere,AFI (FEC),AFI OCT09,RM grants & fees,Dr Mark Clilverd,,macl@bas.ac.uk,NERC British Antarctic Survey,Science Programmes,14/06/2010 00:00,13/06/2014 00:00,N ,N ,01/04/2010 00:00,31/03/2014 00:00,Closed,NERC British Antarctic Survey,High Cross,Cambridge,CB3 0ET,Y ,,316395.45,Atmospheric,Atmospheric: 100%,,Polar South: 100%,"Recent research has suggested that energetic particles entering the Earth's atmosphere at the poles can lead to 5-10 K changes in the surface tempertaures in polar regions during the wintertime. This is thought to be as a result of chemical changes driven by energetic particles enering the Earth's atmosphere at high altitudes (50-90 km) affecting the radiation balance of the atmosphere as a whole. However the exact nature of the particles is unknown, and further analysis/confirmation of the effect on surface temperature variability is limited by this knowledge gap. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by deploying low-powered narrow band radio receivers south of the Antarctic Peninsula in order to monitor energetic particle precipitation coming from the radiation belts that surround the Earth. Only then will the study of the impact of the particles in driving atmospheric chemical changes be possible with any degree of certainty.    Being able to site our experiments in the Antarctic is critical because: 1) the geomagnetic latitudes of the sites chosen for this project are associated with processes occuring at the heart of the outer radiation belt - allowing us to determine the maximum radiation belt particle influence on the atmosphere; 2) the effect of energetic particle precipitation on the experimental radiowave observations that we will make is enhanced over thick ice-sheet regions - this condition only occurs south of the Antarctic Peninsula at the geomagentic latitudes that are needed to make the best observations;  3) the region south of the Antarctic Peninsula is where most of the particle precipitation from the outer radiation belt will occur, because of the influence of the nearby South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly in knocking the energetic particles out of their orbits and into the atmosphere.    The data collected, analysed and interpreted by the project partners brought together by this proposal, will allow us to model the chemical changes in the Antarctic atmosphere due to energetic particle precipitation. As a result we will be able to determine the impact of complex radiation belt processes on the global atmosphere. Our Investigation of the effects on polar surface temperatures is part of international efforts to understand climate variability and the links to the upper atmosphere (e.g. the NERC Science Themes, the Climate and Weather of the Sun-Earth System programme, phase II, and the International Living with a Star programme - ILWS) . Our proposal is also timely in that there will be extensive supporting measurements made during the lifetime of our proposal by x-ray balloons funded by NASA, and by new NASA and CSA radiation belt satellites, all supported by the ILWS programme. Extensive collaboration between this proposal and the balloon/satellite mission scientific teams has been initiated and will continue throughout the project lifetime.","This proposal investigates the impacts of chemical changes resulting from energetic particle preciptation from space, and how this modifies middle atmosphere temperature and dynamics.    The objectives fall into two main areas. One concerns the development and deployment of the receivers, while the other involves the scientific goals that the data will allow us to target.    1.	Design, development and deployment of the low-powered aerial/preamp/data logger system in January 2012.  This experiment will coincide with the first year of the NASA satellite mission Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP).      The first data collection will be in January 2013 which coincides with the Halley/BARREL balloon campaign.  The second data pickup and system removal will be in February 2014.    2.	Specific science objectives will include:  Determination of the occurrence frequency and duration of energetic precipitation events caused by specific types of radiation belt processes, including plasmaspheric hiss, ion cyclotron waves, hiss in plumes, and chorus waves.     Provide comparison data for the NASA BARREL balloon observations to be made in January/February 2013, particularly those from the launch site at Halley to better determine the type and size of the events, and latitude range covered.    Use the multi-site observations of energetic precipitation events to model the radio wave propagation effects such that estimates can be made of the energy spectrum of the precipitating electrons and their fluxes. The inclusion of RBSP/ORBITALS energy spectra data in this analysis will enable deeper understanding of the precipitating fluxes, and their relationship to radiation belt flux levels.    Use the Sodankyla Ion Chemistry (SIC) model to determine the chemical changes induced by each type of radiation belt process, including local time, area, and altitude of the effects.    Use the occurrence frequency analysis, along with the spectral energy ranges, and event fluxes to model the contribution of the radiation belt processes to atmospheric chemical changes, particularly in comparison to other mechanisms, such as solar proton events.    Model the atmospheric dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere polar regions that transports the chemical changes to the middle and lower atmosphere and determine the resultant changes in temperature and dynamics.",,,01/04/2010 00:00,31/03/2014 00:00
